If I'm serving two people, I usually cut one large omelette in half rather than making two omelettes. However, when you feel like being fancy, you can make a pair of two-egg omelettes simply by using half the ingredients for each.

Remove the butter from the freezer and grate it directly into the flour mixture. (Use a cheese grater-it's the best way to break up butter without melting it.) Using your hands, gently squish the butter into the flour until everything is incorporated but not smooth. The chunks of butter will create flaky scones.

Drain the water. Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle safely (but still warm), roughly chop them into bite- sized pieces, if you haven't already.
In a large bowl, mix the olive oil, citrus juice or vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper. Whisk it briskly until the liquid is blended. If you don't have a whisk, simply whip with a fork.

Place the butter in the freezer for 10 minutes, then grate it directly into the flour mixture. Wash and dry your hands, then use them to gently squish the butter into the flour until it looks like bread crumbs.
Make a crater in the flour mixture. Crack the egg into it along with the water. Mix with your hands until it comes together into a smooth ball. If you're using whole-wheat flour and the dough seems dry, add another tablespoon of water. Cover with plastic wrap or a moist towel.
Put the broccoli and water in a pan over medium heat. Cover it with a lid. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until the water is gone and the broccoli is tender.
Meanwhile, crack 8 of the eggs into a bowl, saving the last one for an egg wash later. Mix the eggs with the garlic, chili flakes, salt, and pepper.

Bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat. Add the salt and the cauliflower, then leave it for 4 minutes.
Meanwhile, butter a baking dish large enough to comfortably accommodate all the cauliflower. I usually use a pie dish. Drain the water from the cauliflower and pour it into the baking dish.
To make the sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan on medium heat. Add the garlic, chili flakes, and bay leaf, then cook for about 1 minute. Add the flour and stir quickly. The flour-butter mixture is called a roux. You want the roux to get just a little brown; this will probably take another minute. Slowly add the milk to the pot, stirring all the while to incorporate the roux. Bring the sauce to a boil, stirring every now and then to make sure the sauce doesn't get scorched on the bottom. Once it comes to a boil, turn off the heat and stir in the cheese. Drop in any additions at this point. Taste the sauce and add salt and pepper as needed. You should have a creamy, smooth, savory sauce.
Pour the sauce over the cauliflower. Place the dish in the oven for 40 minutes, or until the top is brown and bubbly. You can also add some breadcrumbs to the top of the dish before baking if you like extra crunch.
Enjoy with a green salad. I also like mine with salsa."""

There are two ways to make this quiche. If you have a cast-iron or other oven-proof skillet, you can make the quiche right in the skillet. This cuts down on dishes. Otherwise, start with a regular skillet and later transfer everything to a pie plate to bake.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add your onion slices and sprinkle a bit of salt and pepper over them. Cook the onions until they are golden brown and starting to caramelize. If your pan is oven-proof, simply remove it from the heat and spread the onions evenly across the bottom. Otherwise, butter a pie plate and scoop the onions into it, creating an even layer on the bottom. The onions add a crust-like texture and a bit of crunch.
A note on vegetables: For things like broccoli, cauliflower or winter squash, I suggest steaming or cooking them before adding them to the quiche to ensure they'll be fully cooked. For tomatoes, zucchini, spinach or any other quick-cooking vegetable, just use them fresh.
Spread the vegetables evenly over top of the onions. The dish or pan should look fairly full.
In a bowl, use a fork to lightly beat the eggs with the milk, cheese, salt, and pepper, just enough to break up the yolks and whites. This is a savory custard mixture. Pour the custard over the vegetables and onions and enjoy watching it fill in all the free spaces.
Bake the quiche in the oven for 1 hour. Once the surface is lightly brown all the way across, it's fully cooked.
Let the quiche cool for about 20 minutes, then slice into wedges and serve with a side salad."""

Clean and chop your vegetables. Generally, I prefer to leave the skin on for the following reasons: skin tastes nice and gets crispy; there's a lot of nutrition in the skin; peeling is slow! Just be sure to wash the vegetables thoroughly.
It's up to you how you want to chop your vegetables. Many are nice roasted whole, like new potatoes or little sunchokes or turnips-they will be crispy and salty on the outside and bursting with fluffy, starchy goodness inside. The general rule is that the smaller you chop things, the faster they cook, so try to keep everything about the same size so nothing cooks faster than anything else.
Dump your vegetables into a roasting pan. Drizzle everything with olive oil or melted butter-about 2 tablespoons per medium-sized roasting pan. Season generously with salt and pepper and add any other extras from the list at right. Use your hands to coat the vegetables thoroughly with the oil and spices.
Pop the pan in the oven for 1 hour or longer, but check on the vegetables after 45 minutes. Test them by poking them with a knife. If it meets no resistance, they're finished; if not, let them cook longer. Don't worry: it's not much of a problem if you overcook them. Unlike vegetables overcooked through boiling or steaming, overcooked roasted vegetables may dry out a bit, but still retain their shape and flavor.
After you pull the vegetables out of the oven, push them around with a spatula to free them from the pan. Remove any garlic cloves and smash them into a fine paste (removing the skins at this point), then put the garlic back in the pan and mix together.

1 tsp clove powder
1 tsp garlic powder

text = """Mix the rub ingredients together. Apply liberally to the pork shoulder, pressing it gently into the meat until you've covered every side. Set any leftover rub aside for later. Place the pork shoulder in a large pot with a tight lid or a Dutch oven. Cover with a towel or lid and leave in the fridge for a few hours or overnight.
Pour enough water into the pot to cover the bottom. This will keep the juices from burning. Put the lid on and place the pot in a 200 °F oven for 10 to 12 hours. I find it's easier if I cook the pork overnight and pull it out in the morning, but you can put it in early in the morning and have it ready for dinner as well.
The supposed rule is that cooking takes 1.5 to 2 hours per pound of pork, but I find it usually takes a little longer than that. You are waiting for the internal temperature to reach 200 °F. The meat is edible at 160 °F, but at higher temperatures the tough connective tissues break down to create the flavor and texture that make pulled pork a delicious and unique treat.
If you don't have a meat thermometer, figuring out the internal temperature is obviously difficult, but you can test it by feel. Poke the meat with a finger: when it's so soft that it falls apart on its own, take it out of the oven.
To pull the meat, remove it from the juices and gently tear the pork apart with two forks or with your hands. Discard any larger bits of fat that you don't wish to eat. If any section is hard to tear apart, the meat hasn't cooked enough to break down the connective tissue. If you have the time to spare, put it back in the oven for another couple of hours.
Once you've pulled all of the pork, mix in any remaining rub and move it to a casserole dish or a large plate. If you aren't eating the meat right away, stash it in the fridge.
Optionally, if you want to make a sauce from the pot full of drippings, bring it to a gentle boil on the stovetop over medium-high heat. Let the juices thicken for 20 to 30 minutes. The fat will rise to the top: it's the clear, thick layer, not the thin, red liquid below. Skim off as much of the fat as possible. Mix a few spoonfuls of the pan drippings with the pork before serving.
Feel free to add a little barbecue sauce to the pork if it isn't flavorful enough for you, but try it first-I think you'll be surprised!
There are a million ways to eat pulled pork, but I like it over squishy hamburger buns or in tacos with crunchy vegetables. Traditionally, pulled pork sandwiches have cabbage slaw on them, but anything crunchy will do. (A diner near my apartment does a great slaw with apple and celery root.)
Don't forget some veggies on the side to round out the meal-a simple green salad, corn on the cob, steamed green beans, or any other summery vegetable."""

text = """In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt. Pour in the yogurt, eggs, and a tablespoon of water. Mix it slowly and carefully. The dough will be quite sticky. Cover it with a towel or plastic wrap while you make the filling.
Put the chopped potatoes in a pot and cover with water, then add a bit of salt. Cover with a lid and bring to a boil over medium-high heat before removing the lid. Let the potatoes cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Test them with a fork: if it goes through easily, they're done.
Drain the potatoes and add shredded cheese, salt, pepper, and any additions you might enjoy. I like strong aged cheese because you don't have to use as much. I usually use several additions, and you should play around with some of your favorite things-there aren't many flavors that don't work in potatoes! Next, mash the potatoes with an electric mixer or just two forks. Once the filling is ready, gather some friends because shaping takes some time!
Flour your countertop liberally. Split the dough in half. Keep one half covered, but place the other half on the floured surface. Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough, about 1/4" thick. Punch out as many 3" to 4" dough circles as possible, using a round cookie cutter or a drinking glass. Squish the scraps into the remaining covered half of the dough.
Drop about a tablespoon of filling in the center of one circle of dough. Fold the dough over the filling and press the edges to create a dumpling. The stickiness should ensure a tight seal. Lay the dumpling on a floured surface and use a fork to squish the edges together. Repeat until you run out of circles, then repeat everything with the remaining dough.
Once you have all your perogies formed, boil a pot of water and add about 12 perogies. Let them cook until they rise to the top, about 1 minute. Pull out the boiled perogies with a spoon, then repeat with the remainder in the same pot of water.
If you're planning to freeze some of the perogies, let them cool down and then put them in freezer bags with the air squeezed out. I usually do 12 to a bag, but you can portion them out in whatever way suits you. They will keep for at least 6 months in the freezer.
You can eat the perogies just boiled, but if you're anything like my family, you'll prefer them fried afterwards. Melt a tablespoon of butter in a pan on medium heat, then fry up as many perogies as you want. (Six per person is plenty.) Flip them every few minutes until they're browned on all sides.

name = "Dumplings"
text = """To save time, see whether your grocery store has pre-made dumpling wrappers, usually in the freezer section or Asian aisle. They come round or square and might be called gyoza or wonton wrappers, but any will work.
If you're making your own dumpling dough, add the flour and salt to a large bowl. Make a crater in the middle and crack in the eggs along with the water. Use one hand like a shovel to mix the dough into a shaggy mass. If it seems too dry, add water a few drops at a time. Knead the dough for a minute, then cover it with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rest for 30 minutes to 2 hours.
Choose one filling or the other. Mix all the filling ingredients in a large bowl.
Once the dough has rested, split it into four chunks. Dust your countertop with flour, then roll the first piece of dough into a log. Leave the other pieces covered so that they don't dry out.
Cut the log into 15 equal slices, then use your hands to form one of the slices into a flat disc. With a rolling pin, flatten the disc into an almost paper-thin circle about the size of a drink coaster.
Place a heaping tablespoon of filling in the center of the dough. Lift all the edges to meet in the middle, then pinch it closed like a little parcel. If the dough won't stick to itself, wet your fingertips and dab the edges.
Repeat until you run out of either filling or dough. This is a great time to ask for help from family or friends-one person rolling while others fill and cook.
Now, a tough decision: do you want to steam, fry, or boil your dumplings?
To steam them, spread a small amount of oil around a large pan. Fill the pan with dumplings-as many as you can fit without them sticking to each other. Turn the heat to medium and let them sizzle for about a minute. Once the dough has absorbed most of the oil, add about 1/2 cup of water to the pan, then quickly cover with a lid. The water will splatter and sizzle loudly. Leave the lid on for about a minute to steam the dumplings, then turn the heat down to low and remove the lid. Let it keep cooking until the water evaporates, then turn off the heat. Your dumplings should be steamed on top with crispy, brown bottoms.
To pan-fry them instead, start following the technique above, but use more oil. Skip the water and the lid entirely. Just keep frying! Once the dumplings are golden on one side, flip them to fry the other side. This method is awkward with parcel-style dumplings but works well for other shapes, so plan accordingly.
Alternatively, boil the dumplings by dropping them into a pot of boiling water. When they rise to the top, they're ready to eat, usually in 1 or 2 minutes."""

Leave the dough in the bowl for an hour, covered by plastic wrap or a moist towel.
Roll the dough into 24 small balls. Keep them covered with the towel.
Lightly flour your countertop. Gently flatten one dough ball with your palm, then roll it out with a rolling pin. Flip it over to make sure it doesn't stick to the counter; add more flour if it does stick. Once you have the ball rolled out nice and thin, set it aside under a moist towel.
Once you've rolled out one or two tortillas, put a non-stick or cast- iron pan on medium-high heat. Let it get nice and hot. Place a tortilla in the pan. Once it starts to dry up around the edges, flip it over with a spatula, then gently press it down to give it some color underneath. Once the tortilla has brown spots on both sides, remove it from the pan and continue with the next. Work quickly! As you wait for each tortilla to cook, roll out more. You'll get better at this part with practice.
If you're serving the tortillas soon, place them in a warm oven to keep them pliable. If they're for later in the day, pile them under a cloth while you finish making them. Once you're done, wrap them in aluminum foil and put them in the fridge. Heat in the oven before serving."""

Place a non-stick skillet on medium heat. Once the pan is hot, add the roti and cook until the dough lifts away from the pan around the edges and small bubbles form. Flip the bread over and cook the other side. Usually it goes very quickly. You want to see light-brown bubbles all over the dough.

ingredients = """3 cups all-purpose or bread flour
1 1/2 tsp salt
1/2 to 1 tsp instant yeast
1 tbsp olive oil
1 1/4 cup water"""
text = """There are two ways to make pizza dough: the fast way and the slow way. They're the same amount of work, just with different waits. The slow method is convenient for a weekday if you make it before bed the night before, pop it in the fridge, then pull it out to rise before dinner.

fast method:
Measure out the flour, salt and a teaspoon of yeast into a big bowl. Mix the oil into the flour with your hands, crumbling it until the texture is a bit sandy, then add the room-temperature water. Keep mixing with your hands until it comes together.
Knead the dough on a lightly floured countertop for 5 to 7 minutes, until it becomes a smooth elastic ball. The dough will be smooth but quite wet.
Add a small amount of oil to a bowl. Place your dough ball in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let it rise for 1 1/2 to 3 hours, depending on the warmth of your kitchen. It's done rising when it has doubled in size. Then it'll be ready to shape into your favorite pizza!

slow method:
If you're organized enough to make the slow dough, I recommend taking the extra time: it's the best.
Use the same process as at the fast method, but add only 1/2 teaspoon of yeast to the flour mixture. Rather than room temperature, the water should be very cold.
After you place the dough ball in a bowl and cover it, put it into the fridge overnight.
Letting the yeast work overnight creates a better flavor; it also makes the dough more elastic and easier to work with.
The next day, 2 to 3 hours before you want to bake your pizzas, remove the dough from the fridge to return to room temperature."""

1 egg
olive oil or vegetable oil"""
text = """Multiply this recipe by the number of people you are serving, maybe a bit less. The stated quantities are a useful ratio, but produce big portions.
Put the flour in a bowl. Make a crater in the center of the flour and crack the egg into it. Mix with your hands. The egg takes a while to release all its moisture, so don't panic if things are dry at first. If, after mixing for about a minute, the dough still seems excessively dry, add a teaspoon of water. Keep mixing until you develop a stiff dough that is quite dry. The dryness makes it easier to roll out and keeps the noodles from sticking together when you cook them.
Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl covered with a moist towel or plastic wrap for 1 or 2 hours.
Once an hour (or more) has passed, you'll notice a marked change in the dough. Now that the egg has released its moisture, you'll have a pale yellow, smooth, pliable dough. Knead again to create a smooth ball.
Tear or slice the dough into manageable pieces-usually as many as the number of people you're feeding. Dust your countertop or cutting board heavily with flour, then use a rolling pin to make the dough as thin as you can. Rolling it out will take a while because it's tough and stretchy. Try to get it thin enough to see light through. The thinner the dough, the quicker it will cook, but don't make the dough so thin that it tears.
By the time the pasta is rolled out, it should be dry enough to avoid sticking to itself. If it's still moist, leave it to sit for a few minutes.
Slice into whatever size of noodles you like. It's easy to make the noodles a consistent size if you fold the dough over itself a few times first. Shake the cut noodles on a tray with a bit of flour to keep them from sticking.
Boil in heavily salted water. Fresh pasta cooks in as little as 30 seconds if the noodles are thin. It's ready when it changes color and starts to float.
You can keep uncooked pasta for up to 2 days in the fridge."""

Beans take vastly different lengths of time to become tender. The older and bigger they are, the longer they take to cook. Very old, very large beans can take as long as four hours.
If you are making refried beans or beans for a soup or stew, don't worry about overcooking them; it's fine if they're mushy. If you want to maintain their shape and integrity, however, monitor them closely once they're getting close to done.

If making breadcrumbs, mince the loaf with a knife, or just tear it apart, or throw small chunks of bread into a food processor. If the bread is too hard to cut, wrap it in a kitchen towel, sprinkle some water on the towel, and microwave for 20 to 30 seconds. This will restore just enough moisture to let you cut the bread easily.
Choose a sufficiently large pan for the quantity of bread cubes or crumbs-or work in batches if you have a lot-and place it on the stovetop on medium heat. Add enough butter or vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan. I prefer the flavor of butter, but use whatever you have.
Let the butter melt or the oil get hot. Add the bread and toss gently until coated. Let the bread sit for 2 minutes, then flip the pieces over. Keep tossing and turning until the bread is brown all over. Add oil or butter as needed and sprinkle with salt and pepper. It is basically impossible, unless you are very patient (which I am not) to get every side of the cubes browned, so just get them generally looking good and toasty and then take them off the heat.
For breadcrumbs, if you like, you can go oil-free: just toast whole slices and then crush it into small pieces.

text="""Summertime salsas combine a load of fresh tomatoes with smaller amounts of choice vegetables and fruit. In the winter, cook canned tomatoes for a few minutes first.
If you like raw onion, go right ahead. Otherwise, take the edge off by sautéing the onion with a bit of water in a pan over medium heat. The onion is ready once the water has boiled off. If you aren't a fan of cilantro, substitute another herb: mint, savory, or lemon balm work well.
Mix the onion, tomato, and the rest of the ingredients in a bowl. Be sure to add enough salt and pepper!
Taste the salsa. You're looking for a balance of spicy from the peppers, sweet from the tomatoes, and bright and fresh from the herbs and lime juice. If something's out of balance, add the appropriate ingredient to bring it back into balance.
Store in an air-tight container in the fridge. Fresh salsa won't last as long as store-bought salsa because it doesn't have any preservatives, but it's so tasty that I'm sure you'll finish it fast!"""

2 tbsp fresh dill, chopped
2 scallions, finely chopped
salt and pepper"""
text="""If you're in a hurry, you don't have to strain this at all: you can just mix the ingredients together. However, removing the water from the cucumber and yogurt intensifies the flavor.
Grate the cucumber and place it in a sieve over a large bowl. Salt the cucumber and mix it around. Leave it for 30 minutes to 2 hours, occasionally pressing the cucumber gently into the sieve to get the liquid out. The salt will help leach the water out of the cucumber.
Line another sieve (or the same one, cleaned) with paper towel or cheesecloth and pour the yogurt into it. You can leave it for as little as 1 hour on the counter or overnight in the fridge. The longer you leave it, the thicker it will get. This is how Greek yogurt is made!
Mix the strained cucumber with the yogurt and the other ingredients, then taste. Adjust the salt and pepper and add any more dill or onion.
Enjoy on sandwiches, as a dip, with pita or tortilla chips, or over meatballs, kebabs or anything spicy."""
